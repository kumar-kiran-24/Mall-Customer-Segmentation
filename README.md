# Customer Segmentation Project

<!--
This README provides an overview of the customer segmentation project, including the clustering comparison, K-Means analysis, and interpretation of the clusters.

The project aims to segment customers based on their behaviors and characteristics using clustering algorithms. It compares different clustering methods using the Rand Index to select the best approach. K-Means clustering is then analyzed in detail for its interpretability.

Each cluster is carefully interpreted and assigned meaningful names that reflect distinct customer profiles, helping businesses target their marketing strategies more effectively.

## Overview
This project performs customer segmentation using clustering algorithms to better understand customer behavior and characteristics. The goal is to group customers into meaningful segments that can guide targeted marketing strategies and improve business decisions.

## Clustering Methods Compared
- Various clustering algorithms were applied to the customer data.
- The clustering results were compared using the **Rand Index**, a measure of similarity between different clusterings.
- This comparison helps identify the most suitable clustering method for the dataset.

## K-Means Clustering Analysis
- K-Means was selected as the most interpretable clustering method.
- The characteristics of each cluster were analyzed by examining key features such as purchase behavior, demographics, and engagement metrics.
- Clusters were given meaningful names based on their distinctive traits, aiding in business interpretation.

## Cluster Interpretation
- Each cluster represents a customer segment with unique profiles.
- For example, clusters may represent “Loyal Customers,” “Discount Seekers,” or “Infrequent Buyers.”
- These insights help in tailoring marketing campaigns and improving customer relationship management.

## Usage
- Run the notebook/script to replicate the clustering process.
- Review the detailed analysis to understand the segmentation logic.
- Use the segment labels to guide targeted marketing and personalization efforts.

## Future Work
- Incorporate additional features for better segmentation.
- Explore other clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction techniques.
- Validate the segments with real-world business outcomes.
